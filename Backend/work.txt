You are a senior Python backend engineer. Create a minimal but production-ready starter project with the following requirements:

Tech stack:
- FastAPI (async)
- MongoDB using `motor` (AsyncIOMotorClient)
- GridFS (via Motor) to store JPEG images in MongoDB
- Celery for background jobs
- Redis as the Celery broker (and result backend if needed)
- Python 3.11+

High‑level requirements:
- An `/upload` POST endpoint that:
  - Accepts multipart/form-data with:
    - `data`: JSON string (field)
    - `file`: JPEG image (file)
  - Validates that `data` is valid JSON
  - Stores:
    - JSON into a MongoDB `inputs` collection
    - JPEG into GridFS and references its file_id in the document
  - Sets `status = "pending"` for the input document
  - Enqueues a Celery task `process_task(record_id: str)` and returns `{"id": record_id}`

- A Celery worker that:
  - Connects to the same MongoDB and GridFS
  - Given `record_id`, fetches the input document
  - (For now) does dummy processing and creates an `outputs` document with:
    - `input_id`
    - `output_json = {"status": "processed", "input_id": record_id}`
  - Updates the input document `status` from `"pending"` to `"done"`

Project structure (feel free to improve names, but keep it clean and modular):
- `app/main.py`      -> FastAPI app and routes
- `app/models.py`    -> Pydantic models
- `app/db.py`        -> Mongo/Motor + GridFS setup
- `app/celery_app.py`-> Celery configuration
- `app/tasks.py`     -> Celery tasks + async helpers
- `requirements.txt`
- `README.md`

Implementation details:
- Use environment variables for:
  - `MONGO_URI` (default: `mongodb://localhost:27017`)
  - `MONGO_DB_NAME` (default: `mydatabase`)
  - `REDIS_URL` (default: `redis://localhost:6379/0`)
- Provide a `.env.example` file showing these variables.
- Use Pydantic models where appropriate (e.g., for the JSON payload).
- Make the FastAPI route fully async.
- Show how to start:
  - The FastAPI server with `uvicorn`
  - The Celery worker (exact command)
- Add at least one simple endpoint `/status/{id}` that returns the current document for that `id` from `inputs` (so I can check if `status` changed to `"done"`).

Output:
1. The full project tree.
2. The content of each file (only the essential code, no filler comments).
3. Exact commands to:
   - Install dependencies
   - Run MongoDB and Redis (assume local dev)
   - Start FastAPI app
   - Start Celery worker

Make the code clean, minimal, and ready for me to extend with real processing logic later.
